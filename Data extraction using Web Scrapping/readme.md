# What is web scraping?
Web scraping (also known as web harvesting or web data extraction) is a technique used to extract large amounts of data from websites automatically. It involves automated software tools that navigate through web pages, collect and extract data from them. This data can then be saved in a structured format, such as a spreadsheet, database or CSV file, for further analysis.</br>
In some of the websites the data can't be extracted directed because the website doesn't provide the API, in that case we can implement the Web Srcaping to collect our data.
We can use the library BeautifulSoup
