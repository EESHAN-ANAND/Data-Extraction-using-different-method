# What is API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of protocols, tools, and routines that developers use to interact with a web-based software application or web tool. An API provides a way for two different applications to communicate with each other, allowing them to share data and functionality.<br/>
To extract data from a website using an API, you first need to find out if the website provides an API and what type of API it is.<br/>
Once you have access to the API, you can use programming languages to send requests to the API and receive data in a format like JSON or XML.<br/>

### Where the data is extracted?
The data is extrated from the IMDB database using the IMDB api.</br> 
Using the API url provided from the IMDB website we can access the data of the top rated movies which is present in the json format and we can work out our way through pyhon using the request library.
